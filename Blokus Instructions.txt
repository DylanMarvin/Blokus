How to play Blokus

PLAYERS REQUIRED:
4

OBJECTIVE:
To place all your pieces on the board. If no one can place a piece on the board,
the player with the least amount of pieces left wins. (The game will not indicate if you
win. You will have have to decide that yourself)

SPECIFICATIONS:
When the game starts, there will be 4 sides with 21 pieces. The side that
is black will indicate that player's turn.

RULES:
The first piece must be placed in their color specific corner. The first click MUST BE
on the corner.
You must position your piece so that it touches another piece of your same color.
Those pieces CANNOT touch sides; they can only meet at corners.
Make sure your piece preview does not go outside of the board or else you have to restart.
DO NOT put pieces on top of other pieces.
If you wish to rotate a piece, select your piece and press R to rotate your piece 90 
degrees.

CHALLENGES:
IF YOU COMPLETE A CHALLENGE, YOUR REWARD IS REMOVING ANY ONE OF YOUR PIECES.
There will be random challenges throughout the rounds. If you complete a challenge, your
side will turn pink and this will allow you to select one of your pieces to remove them.
